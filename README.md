This project implements a hybrid deep learning model for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG data. The model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) for capturing temporal dependencies, and a Transformer encoder for modeling long-range dependencies. The dataset(UCI Epileptic Seizure Recognition) is preprocessed with standardization and reshaped for 1D convolution, with labels encoded for binary classification (seizure vs. non-seizure). The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, trained with categorical cross-entropy loss, and optimized with Adam. Key features include batch normalization, dropout for regularization, and stratified train-test splitting to handle class imbalance. The project achieves robust performance for seizure detection, with potential applications in medical diagnostics.
